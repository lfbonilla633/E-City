incorporating recent research progresses made in earthquake data observation and 
numerical modelling in the near fault environment. The key scientific questions are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how the spatial variability and the particularity of the near-fault seismic 
ground motion impact the soil and the structure; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how these seismic excitations 
damage and change the medium properties; and &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how the building clusters contribute 
to the spatial variability of the near-fault ground motion in urban environment. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, we bring both numerical and observational approaches to study the 2016 
Kumamoto in Japan and the 2019 Ridgecrest in California earthquakes. These events 
have a large number of records in the vicinity of the epicentral area, whose analysis 
will address questions 1 and 2 and bring an international collaboration with colleagues 
from Japan, USA, and Ecuador. Question 3 will be conveyed by demonstrating the impact 
of a building environment on the seismic risk assessment targeting the city of Quito 
(Ecuador), which is located on a piggyback basin created on the hanging wall of an 
active reverse fault. The civil engineering structure and site characteristics are 
known thanks to semi-dense temporary networks deployed in the open/urban transition 
area (ANR REMAKE, 2015-2019). Our project responds to the needs of 
low-probability-high-consequences (LPHC) seismic risk in urban areas subjected 
to nearby earthquakes faults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is funded by the French ANR for a period of 48 months starting on January 2022. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Project"></category></entry></feed>
