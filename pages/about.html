            <h3>Objectives and research hypothesis</h3>
<p>Between 1998-2017, earthquakes caused nearly 750 000 deaths globally; more 
than half of all deaths related to natural disasters 
<a href="http://who.int">(World Health Organization)</a>. Such 
significant human and/or economic losses occurred by earthquakes near urban 
areas such as Haiti (2010), Christchurch (NZ, 2011), Nepal (2015), 
Kumamoto (Japan, 2016), Amatrice-Norcia (Italy, 2016). The general objective 
of this project is to respond to the needs of low-probability-high-consequences 
(LPHC) seismic risk in urban areas subjected to nearby earthquakes faults, 
by incorporating recent research progresses made in earthquake data 
observation and numerical modelling beyond the current seismic risk 
assessment framework.</p>
<p>Specific objectives, organized as work packages and related tasks in the 
project, are summarized in Figure 1 and explained as follows. 
<strong>Objective 1: near-fault simulation of ground motion (including 
spatial variability).</strong> Near-field ground motion is complex and 
spatially heterogeneous due to the fault geometry, near-surface 
geology, off-fault plasticity and secondary faults (special volume 
by Dalguer et al., 2020). Impulsive pulses observed near the fault 
from past earthquakes (e.g. 2003 Denali, 2016 Kumamoto), also known 
as <em>“killer pulse”</em> during the 1995 Kobe earthquake, reflect the 
mechanical properties of the causal earthquake fault. Therefore, we 
need to take into account its mechanical behavior in three-dimensional 
Physics-Based Simulations (PBSs) when predicting the near-source 
ground motion (e.g. Aochi and Ulrich, 2015). <strong>Objective 2: Soil/Structure 
time dependent behavior.</strong> Recent robust analysis of seismic data recorded 
in soils and buildings found that the media properties such as the 
frequency content and shear wave velocity vary with time 
(Astorga et al., 2018 for a building; Bonilla et al., 2019 for a 
sedimentary site, both during the Mw9 Tohoku 2011 earthquake). Often 
related to primary co-seismic nonlinear response of the uppermost soil 
layers or the structural elements of buildings, the damaging and 
healing time-dependent processes of the medium are not clear and must 
be deeply investigated in relation to the particular near-field ground 
motion features. <strong>Objective 3: Near-fault seismic risk analysis for town.</strong> 
The near-fault characteristics should be considered in seismic risk 
assessment, particularly related to the spatial variability of the induced 
ground motion including cross-coupling with the buildings. Seismic ground 
motion in urban environment will be analyzed, with a special focus on the 
rotational ground motion and the impulse wave impact on the building 
response (linear and nonlinear) and the contamination of the ground motion 
features due to the presence of neighboring buildings. <strong>Finally, rotational 
motion and spatial variability will be integrated to estimate their impact 
for future near-fault earthquake scenarios in Quito (Ecuador) as a target.</strong></p>
<p>Our common research hypothesis is that the medium and materials are damaged 
and their properties vary with time during strong ground shaking or 
repeated seismic excitations. This can be detected by analysis of 
seismic records using advanced time-frequency signal processing tools. 
However, it is not clear where such nonlinear processes come from, 
other than the site effect in the near surface and the classical 
nonlinear response of buildings. We are particularly interested in 
two prevalent near-fault ground motion features (a) impulsive wave and 
(b) rotational motion and their impact on this nonlinear response. 
Both features will be considered commonly in this project beyond the 
current practice, and the abundant data sets of recent earthquakes 
will allow us to analyze more precisely these phenomena in space and 
time. The intensive numerical models including nonlinear behavior will 
help to assess the realistic near-fault seismic excitation levels and 
their impacts. Quito (Ecuador) is known as high-seismic risk city, 
and has often been targeted in previous ANR projects (Andes du Nord, 
2008-2012; and REMAKE, 2015-2019). We can benefit from the past 
experiences and will provide a physics-based seismic risk assessment 
to the city.</p>
